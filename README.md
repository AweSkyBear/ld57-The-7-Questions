# The 7 Questions

Sharing the source for my entry created in 3 days for [Ludum Dare 57 - The 7 Questions](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/57/the-7-questions), the JAM format (although I had much less time for actual coding during that time).

All graphics and music are original. More about the game on the game page link above.

Template originally started from the official [Phaser Vite TypeScript Template](https://github.com/phaserjs/template-vite-ts)
but I've also added my helper lib to deal with clean object management: [obs-disp](https://github.com/AweSkyBear/obs-disp)
